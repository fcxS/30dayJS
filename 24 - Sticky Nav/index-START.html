    <blockquote><em>‘Thebee is more honored than other animals, not because she labors, but because she labors for others’  <p></p>– St. John Chrysostom. 🐝</p></em></blockquote> 
    <p>Not only is the humble bee an incredible pollinator, responsible for helping the growth of some of our favorite treats including coffee and chocolate, but it’s the only insect in the world to produce food that humans can eat.
     Over the last two decades, startling research has shown that this hardworking creature – once described by Earthwatch as the ‘most invaluable species on the planet’ – is in rapid decline. Since 2006, the USA’s commercial honeybee population has suffered a 40% loss, with the UK reporting an even greater loss of 45% since just 2010.</p>
    <p>
      <h3>What this Decline Could Mean for Us🐝</h1>
        <h4>A Devastating Impact on Our Food Supply🐝</h2>
            Bees are responsible for pollinating many of our key fruit and vegetable crops. In fact, without their help over one third of our crop supply could be in danger of disappearing. Without the busy bees, we might have to say goodbye to almonds, apples, apricots, blueberries, strawberries, tomatoes and zucchini to name just a few. Even worse, with such a dip in food supplies, we could struggle to sustain our global population.

    <p>
      <h3>A Rise in the Cost of Food Production🐝</h3>
      If we don’t have bees to cross-pollinate for us, the job may need to be done by hand – a labor intensive and financially draining task, at an estimated potential cost of €265 billion annually worldwide. That translates to some very expensive fruits and vegetables for consumers! Of course, this is not a true estimate as, should the bees and their natural pollination techniques disappear completely, their services might prove impossible to replace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>A Serious Effect on Wild Flowers & Animal Life🐝</h3>
      Approximately 250,000 species of flowering plants depend on bees to help them pollinate. Without these incredible insects, many wild flowers and other plants would struggle to reproduce. As these flowers and their berries are often a source of food for insects, birds and small mammals, it could have severe consequences for the survival of such creatures. In turn, larger predators would find their food supply affected and also struggle to survive.
    </p>
    <h3>A World Without Honey🐝</h3>
    <img src="https://www.naturallivingideas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/honey-2.jpg" class="align-left slide-in" style="width:600px;height:400px" />
    <p>While the other effects of a decline in our bee population are far more alarming, it’s worth remembering that this ancient natural sweetener – with the host of health benefits it’s said to bring – could be lost forever.</p>
    <p>
      <h3>What’s Happening To All the Bees?🐝</h3>
      Experts cite a variety of different causes for the loss of these noble creatures, including:
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>The Use of Insecticides🐝</h4>
      <img src="https://www.naturallivingideas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/insecticide.jpg" class="align-left slide-in" style="width:600px;height:400px" />
      Believed to be responsible for the most dramatic losses of the global bee colonies, insecticides have been found to be present in pollen and nectar, meaning these chemicals are ingested by bees and other pollinators. Pesticides affect bees in a number of ways including their developmental rate, feeding behavior and even by affecting their learning process through neurotoxins, which impact their flower and nest recognition abilities along with their navigation skills. In addition, insecticides compromise their immune systems, making them more vulnerable to disease and parasites. The possible effects these chemicals have on our own health should also be a cause for concern. This short video by Pesticide Action Network Europe shows how insecticide-coated seeds (which are commonly used today in large-scale agriculture for pest management) are contributing to an environment which is toxic to bees.

    <p>
      <h4>Destruction of Natural Habitat🐝</h4>
      Both through urbanization and the increasing need for more agricultural land, we are systematically destroying our woodlands, grasslands, forests, fields and hedgerows – all the natural habitats of pollinators. This is believed to be a major cause of declining wild bee populations, as well as being responsible for a fall in the numbers of other plant and animal species.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Climate Change🐝</h4>
      The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) believes that the effects of climate change – rising temperatures, fluctuations in rainfall and generally more extreme weather conditions – have an impact on pollinator lifespan and practices. This global warming may also affect the natural synchronization between bees and plant life cycles.
